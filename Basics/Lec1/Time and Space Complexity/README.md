# Time complexity

The time complexity of a particular code depends on the given input size, not on the machine used to run the code.

if the number of steps will be then N*3 = 3N and the time complexity will be O(3*N)

<pre>
Here come the three rules, that we are going to follow while calculating the time complexity:  
  1. We will always calculate the time complexity for the worst-case scenario.
  2. We will avoid including the constant terms.
  3. We will also avoid the lower values.

>O(1) — Constant time
>O(n) — Linear time
>O(n²) — Quadratic time
>O(log n) — Logarithmic time (An algorithm is O(log n) when it divides the input in half (or a constant fraction) at every step.)
>O(n log n) — Linearithmic time (An algorithm is O(n log n) when it performs a logarithmic number of operations per element.)

# Space Complexity
Space complexity generally refers to the memory space that a code uses while being executed. 
Represent the space complexity using the Big O notation.
If we use an array of size n, the space complexity will be O(N).
